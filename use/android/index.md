### Option 1: Build Android Apps using F# and Xamarin

F# supports the development of Android applications using the [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) tools.

#### Installing

1. Install [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/), or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/getting-started/).

2. Select the .NET Mobile Development tools with F# Language support as part of installation.

#### Going Further

[Fabulous](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/) is a framework for F# Functional App Development, using declarative dynamic UI.
This allows you to use the ultra-simple MVU (Model-View-Update) architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more using Xamarin.Forms. 

See [Getting Started with Fabulous](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/Fabulous.XamarinForms/index.html#getting-started).
