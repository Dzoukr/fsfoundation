F# executes on app platforms including as  [Android, iOS](/use/mobile-apps/), [Mac OS X](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/React/ReactNative](/use/webapps/) and [Windows](/use/windows/). Its concise syntax, interoperability with .NET libraries, and its ability to manage complexity of components such as state machines, calculation engines and more make it an ideal tool for many aspects of app development.
